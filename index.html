            Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person
            thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like
            they have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for them
            and for their family and friends. The symptoms of schizophrenia can
            make it difficult to participate in usual, everyday activities, but
            effective treatments are available. Many people who receive
            treatment can engage in school or work, achieve independence, and
            enjoy personal relationships.

            Itâ€™s important to recognize the symptoms of schizophrenia and seek
            help as early as possible. People with schizophrenia are usually
            diagnosed between the ages of 16 and 30, after the first episode of
            psychosis. Starting treatment as soon as possible following the
            first episode of psychosis is an important step toward recovery.
            However, research shows that gradual changes in thinking, mood, and
            social functioning often appear before the first episode of
            psychosis. Schizophrenia is rare in younger children. Schizophrenia
            symptoms can differ from person to person, but they generally fall
            into three main categories: psychotic, negative, and cognitive.

            Most people with schizophrenia are not violent. Overall, people with
            schizophrenia are more likely than those without the illness to be
            harmed by others. For people with schizophrenia, the risk of
            self-harm and of violence to others is greatest when the illness is
            untreated. It is important to help people who are showing symptoms
            to get treatment as quickly as possible.
